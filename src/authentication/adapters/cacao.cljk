;; Bridges to kotoba-lang/cacao's cacao.core/verify + verify-chain -- the same
;; self-issued, no-owner-hand-off CACAO kekkai/kagi actors mint. Pure/offline:
;; did:key CACAO verification needs no injected host port, unlike every other
;; production adapter in this repo (webauthn/faceid/touchid all wrap a real
;; verifier port because their crypto lives on a device/OS the code can't
;; reach directly).

   (e.g. \"2026-07-10T03:24:26Z\") -- the same shape cacao mint/verify
   fixtures use throughout this org, so plain string `compare` against a
   CACAO's :iat/:exp (also caller-supplied in that shape) sorts correctly.
   java.time.Instant's default .toString() has VARIABLE fractional-second
   precision (0, 3, 6, or 9 digits depending on the instant), which would
   compare incorrectly against a whole-second mint-time value in some
   cases -- truncating to SECONDS first avoids that entirely."

  "Real ICacaoVerifier via cacao.core. `payload`'s `:response` must carry

   (an ordered vector of cacao-b64 strings, a delegation chain -- verified via
   `cacao.core/verify-chain`). Never `:phishing-resistant` on its own (see
   ADR-2607050400: SIWE/EIP-4361 signing has no browser/OS-enforced origin
   binding the way WebAuthn does, so a CACAO factor's assurance tops out at
   `:single-factor` here regardless of the signature's own validity).

   `now-fn` is a 0-arg fn returning the current instant (real-now's shape);
   called FRESH on every verify-cacao! call, never baked in at construction
   time, so a long-lived verifier instance always checks against the actual
   current moment -- threaded through as cacao.core/verify's/verify-chain's
   :now option to reject an expired or not-yet-valid CACAO. Confirmed bug
   this closes: this adapter never checked expiry at all -- a captured
   CACAO could be replayed indefinitely against the real production auth
   path, regardless of cacao.core itself supporting an expiry check.
   Defaults to real-now (the real wall clock); inject a fake now-fn for
   deterministic tests."
